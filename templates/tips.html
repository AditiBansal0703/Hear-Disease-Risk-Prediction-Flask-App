        <b>🥦 Eat a healthy balanced diet (lots of fruits & veggies!)</b>
        <p>A heart-healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Foods like berries, leafy greens, nuts, and fish are rich in nutrients that reduce inflammation and improve heart health. Aim for a Mediterranean-style diet rich in antioxidants, fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>🏃‍♂️ Stay physically active — at least 30 mins a day</b>
        <p>Exercise is crucial for heart health. Regular physical activity helps improve circulation, lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol, and control weight. Activities like walking, cycling, swimming, or jogging for at least 30 minutes a day can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>🚭 Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake</b>
        <p>Smoking damages blood vessels, increases blood pressure, and raises the risk of heart disease. If you smoke, quitting is one of the most significant steps you can take to protect your heart. Additionally, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to high blood pressure and weight gain, so it’s essential to limit your intake.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>🧘 Manage stress through meditation and mindfulness</b>
        <p>Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure, heart disease, and other health issues. Practices like meditation, yoga, deep breathing, and mindfulness can help lower stress, improve mental well-being, and keep your heart healthy. Taking time to relax and de-stress every day is important.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>💧 Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy weight</b>
        <p>Drinking enough water is essential for circulation, kidney function, and heart health. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water per day. Maintaining a healthy weight through a combination of diet and exercise helps reduce the strain on your heart, lowers cholesterol, and improves overall health.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>🩺 Regular health checkups (BP, cholesterol, sugar)</b>
        <p>Regular health checkups allow you to monitor your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. Early detection of high blood pressure or cholesterol can help prevent heart disease. Make sure to visit your doctor for routine checkups and screenings to keep track of your heart health.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>😴 Get good quality sleep (7-8 hours a night)</b>
        <p>Quality sleep is vital for heart health. Lack of sleep is linked to high blood pressure, increased inflammation, and higher cholesterol levels. Ensure you get 7-8 hours of restful sleep each night to support your heart’s recovery and maintain optimal cardiovascular health.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>🥑 Include heart-healthy foods (nuts, fish, olive oil)</b>
        <p>Incorporate foods like almonds, walnuts, and oily fish (like salmon and mackerel) into your diet, as they are rich in healthy fats and omega-3 fatty acids. Olive oil is another great heart-healthy fat that can reduce inflammation and improve cholesterol levels. A diet rich in these foods can help protect your heart from disease.</p>

        <b>🚶‍♀️ Take regular breaks from sitting</b>

      </li>
      
      <li>
        <b>🧂 Limit your salt intake</b>
